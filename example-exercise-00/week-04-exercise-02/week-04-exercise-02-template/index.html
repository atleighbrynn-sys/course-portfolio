        <p>
             Hello I absolutely love daft punk, any album but mainly the beginning of them like homework and the discovery album. Now for movies i love a good psycological horror movie which midsommer and long legs are. Another is the shows.
            I love the walking dead i fully believe that the zombie apocolyps is coming. Another is One tree hill. I love the characters and never ending drama.

                    It was a very good movie. It was the best of both worlds with the psychological horror and the creepness.
